## Introduction
This is a web application created for the purpose of becoming my personal portfolio page, which will be updated as more apps are created. This portfolio page will display my talent and skills as a web developer to potential employers.

## Technologies
Technologies used in this portfolio creation include:
- My own HTML page, created from scratch. 
- My own CSS style sheet, created from scratch. 
- Other assets such as my own images to show employers how I look like, alongside placeholder images from Shutterstock (will  be replaced with applications  I create in the future). 

## Project Requirements
Below are the requirements for this portfolio page:
- Employers can view my deployed portfolio.
- Employers can view my deployed work samples. 
- Employers can assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position in their company.
